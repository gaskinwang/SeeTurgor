# SeeTurgor
SeeTurgor is to gain insights into the arrangement of turgidity in a
multicellular tissue. It aims to provide rounded toolboxes for post analysis,
after measured various sets of on-site turgor pressures of cells neighbored in
random directions and photographed homorganic tissue sections. SeeTurgor first
performs turgor prediction at any tangent plane of a plant meristem by utilizing
an [FCN] based model to segment cell walls, cooperating with genetic algorithm to 
generate an optimal cell wall patterned graph solution that satisfies the problem's 
statement: the data set extracted from the graph is at highest similar with experimental measurements. Then,
abstract the layer-based turgor characters with breadth-first search algorithm,
followed by 3-D modeling.

The repository contains code for cell wall morphological segmentation, medial
axis transform, genetic algorithm, Breadth-first search algorithm, turgor
simulation in dome-shaped meristem in MATLAB and Python.

# Requirements: 
The code requires MATLAB2016a, python 3.6 as well as the
following python libraries:

-   OpenCV
-   matplotlib
-   numpy
-   Pillow
-   scipy
-   commentjson

CorelDRAW is also needed for vectorization and manually tracing the fuzzy parts
of cell walls that are out the limit of artificial intelligence (i.e., FCN) to
recognize.

# Tutorial

**A.	Trace Cell Contours in Microphotographs by Utilizing A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) Based Model**

1.  Call function *imagecut.m* to cut the paired, same sized **demo.png** and
    **label.png** to small images with same rules. We selected 12 demo.png
    images in advance. Each has \>100 cells. We labeled cell walls manually
    using lines in corelDRAW.

2.  Run *edge2red.py* to change the label lines of the images cut from the
    **label.png** to red color, forming **label set**.

3.  Run *RGB2grayscale.py* to change the RGB images cut from the **demo.png** to
    grayscale, 3-channel images, forming **demo set**.

4.  Gather **label set** and **demo set** together forming **training set**.

5.  Train the *FCN* based model on the **training set** as [described], outputting **trained model**.

6.  Run *RGB2grayscale.py* to change the RGB-mode **candidate.png** to
    grayscale, 3-channel images, outputting **g_candidate.png.**

7.  Let the **trained model** read **g_candidate.png**, outputting
    **reference.png**.

8.  Run *Skeletonization.py* to reduce foreground regions in **reference.png**
    to a skeletal remnant, outputting **sk_reference.png**.

9. Vectorize **de_reference.png** in CorelDRAW X6, complement the gaps manually
    by referencing the **candidate.png**, and save cell boundaries structured at
    0.2 mm thickness lines as the name of **data.png**. Pay attention to the
    relative size of cells in **data.png**.

**B.  Number Cells and Obtain Coordinate Values of Cell Boundaries**

10. Run *GetCentra.m* to number cells by clicking the mouse at any point of a
    cell, by using **demo.png** as input and calling *circleplot.m*. Output
    **Data2.mat** and **centre.xlsx**.

11. Run *GetBound.m* to trace cell boundaries of **demo.png** using
    **Data2.mat** and **centre.xlsx** as inputs. Output **Bound4Cell.mat**.

12. Run *visualization.m* to visualize and check traced cells and their numbers.
    Output **show.fig**.

   **13b. FOR Three-PART MODELLING**

   i.  Run *cal4divide.m* (which calls *visualization.m* which uses **Data2.mat**,
    **Centre.mat** and **Bound4Cell.mat** as inputs) with pre-opened
    **show.fig** to divide cells to three groups with two point-point lines, by
    clicking the mouse and using **Centre.mat** as input. Output **select.xlsx**
    and **select.mat**.

    using **Data2.mat**, **Centre.mat**, **Bound4Cell.mat** and **select.xlsx**
    as inputs.
